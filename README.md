In this project, we step into the role of a Data Analyst at a renowned global IT and business consulting firm celebrated for its expertise in IT solutions and a team of seasoned IT consultants. The organization, committed to staying abreast of evolving technologies and maintaining its competitive edge, regularly conducts data analyses to forecast future skill demands.

As Data Analysts, our mission is to contribute to this endeavor by gathering data from diverse sources and pinpointing trends for this year's report on emerging skills.

Our initial focus revolves around aggregating the most sought-after programming skills from a spectrum of outlets including job postings, training portals, and surveys.

Once we amass sufficient data, our analysis journey begins, delving into the data to extract insights and discern patterns.

Each stage of our data analysis journey is encapsulated in distinct notebooks within this repository, accompanied by supplementary files to aid comprehension.
